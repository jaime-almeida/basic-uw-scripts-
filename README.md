# Basic subduction zone UW1 scripts.
This repository contains the scripts used for the creation of the Underworld 1 model shown in Jaime Almeida's PhD thesis.

- main.xml: Main UW1 script where the geometry and rheology are defined;
- main_V.xml:  Additional file which contains the kinematic boundary conditions
- main_T.xml:  Additional file which contains the thermal boundary and initial conditions
- optional_NB.xml:  Additional file which contains the definitions for irregular mesh conditions (node bunching)

All scripts are commented and should be easy to follow. Any questions please contact me at jealmeida@fc.ul.pt
